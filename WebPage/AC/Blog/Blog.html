    <h1>Everland</h1>
    <h4>The History of Everland.</h4>
    <p>Everland wasn't always a peaceful world the history isn't as bright as they told in the storybooks, let me tell you a
    story, a story about trickery, betrayal, war, and hate. It all started a few million years ago there was a war, not any
    ordinary war, a great war between the two biggest realms of Everland, The Dragon Realm with The Human Realm. It all
    started one day, as The Great priest was praying he was contacted by a God, but not any old God, It was Loki the
    trickster God pretending to be the human's God, the Great priest all humbled by getting contacted by his "God" asked him
    why is he contacting him, the trickster God foretold a future prophecy envisioning the dragons scorching the whole
    realm, the priest all shocked rushed into the throne room, he begged to be heard as the King stopped him letting him
    talk, the Great Priest foretold the prophecy to the royal family. The King without a single doubt instantly sends his
    knights, the human knights would attack the dragon villages killing the whole village, but the humans didn't do it for
    sport (even though a few did) they were following orders, but most of them were scared of the Dragons power, that could
    wipe out whole armies but with the help of the heavens the trickster God sends down his Angels to help kill off the
    Dragons. The Dragon's numbers were dwindling until the Dragon King of that time chose to sacrifice his own life to end
    the conflict. His brother Dëmos was heir to the throne and was nominated as the new king, but his hate for humans never
    dwindled. Peace ruled the realm for a period until one-night Dëmos was visited by the Trickster God feed fule into the
    flames, lying to the Dragon King that the humans only took his life so they could weaken their people making them think
    they're safe for them to attack them ones again, the Dragon King didn't hesitate one second he sends some his soldiers
    to strike the human villages close to the realm opening with the help of recruited hellspawn that the trickster god
    reinforced the Dragon kings army. The Human king has soon been notified about the Dragon attacks without a second
    thought he commanded an all-out war against the Dragons, the war was long and gruesome many lives were lost on both
    sides but the humans with their overwhelming numbers were able to push back the Dragons, holy powers of the Angels kept
    the tide of war in the human's favor. With nowhere else to go the Dragon King had no other choice but to close off the
    rift to the Human realm, trapping out the dragons that were fighting.</p>
